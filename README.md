# offlineJavaDataBase
This project is created using only the Java language. Using Ceasar Shift Cypher (character shifting encryption) allows for the secure storage of data and the creation of a password that would eventually decrypt the data. The data is comprised of people's personal information (name, phone number, address, etc.). Prevelent methods include but are not limited to: printing the entire decrypted list of people, adding people to the list, searching for certain people in the list using known information, and changing the password.
